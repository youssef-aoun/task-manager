  # Using custom queries & Raw SQL in Rails:
  # You can search for task by writing part of it's title like follows:
  # Task.where("title ILIKE ?", "%Deploy%")


  # You can also search for pending tasks without having to write full query by just writing Task.pending
  # All of this thanks to the above scope created.
  # Advanced query: Task.where("title ILIKE ? AND status = ?", "%Deploy%", "pending")



  # To avoid N+1 queries, we can use includes, preload, or eager_load
  # Practicing includes:

  # associations(dev)> tasks = Task.all
  #   Task Load (0.7ms)  SELECT "tasks".* FROM "tasks" /* loading for pp */ LIMIT 11 /*application='Associations'*/
  # =>
  # [#<Task:0x0000023a20199c48
  # ...
  # associations(dev)* tasks.each do |task|
  # associations(dev)*   puts task.user.name
  # associations(dev)> end
  #   Task Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "tasks".* FROM "tasks" /*application='Associations'*/
  #   User Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 1 LIMIT 1 /*application='Associations'*/

  #   User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 1 LIMIT 1 /*application='Associations'*/

  # The above way, for each task, Rails runs a separate query for user
  # If you have 100 tasks, you will execute 101 queries (1 for tasks + 100 for users!). ‚ùå SLOW!


  # Whereas if we use includes
  # tasks = Task.includes(:user)
  # tasks.each do |task|
  #   puts task.user.name
  # end


  # SELECT * FROM tasks;
  # SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
  # Only 2 queries instead.
